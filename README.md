Used Nextjs so backend/api's are all in api folder.
Replaced products, order, orders, product with fakestore api as it has more data and makes the experience seamless. Used Next-Auth with firebase and google auth for customers/users. Stripe for a seamless checkout process. Redux for global state management of products.
